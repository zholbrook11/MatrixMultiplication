## Matrix Multiplication

This Java program performs matrix multiplication either by reading matrices from user-specified files or by generating random square matrices. Depending on user input, it can read matrix data from files or generate random matrices, perform the matrix multiplication, and save the resulting matrix to a file.

## Input Options

File Input:
If the user provides two valid matrix files, the program reads them as matrices.
The matrices must meet the multiplication requirement (the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix).

Integer Input:
If the user provides an integer, the program generates two random square matrices of the given size and performs matrix multiplication.
